# where is the code?
There is no code (yet). I don't even own a SMART table myself. But I am making quite some progress on reverse engineering the USB protocol (which is quite easy considering that at the time, the company did things like make a Linux version or make a 'debugging suite' with verbose logging). I will try to cover the journey from the start (excluding the bad paths I only took because of weird reasons), but it's not going to be the same as if I did this continuously from the start.

So, click on the Wiki if you want to know more (not visible on mobile layout for unclear reasons)
